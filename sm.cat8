     ssooffttmmooddeemm is an audio software modem, that connects your soundcard with a
     tty.

     It logs to a .log file in the current directory, and puts the name of the
     tty it has opened in a .tty file.

     It can be run as normal user, or as root to enable use of -d option. If
     run as root, it will drop privileges to _sm user, and the opened tty will
     have _sm ownership.

     The options are as follows:

     --vv      Increase verbosity, one for info and two for debug

     --gg      Use GUI, if it was compiled in

     --cc      Indicate that we are the caller modem

     --pp      Jack should automaticaly connect to the system audio input /
             output

     --dd      Create a symbolic link from /dev/sm (or the name used in -n) to
             the /dev/tty* wich was opened. If used, there will be no sm.tty
             file created.

     --nn _n_a_m_e
             Name that softmodem will have, defaults to sm. It will be used as
             jack client name, log file name, tty file name, and process name
             in OpenBSD.

     --mm _m_o_d_e_m_[_,_o_p_t_i_o_n_]
             Type of modem to use. You can use v22bis, fsk_v21, fsk_v23 or
             v27ter.  The options must be ordered like the following list and
             separated by a coma; empty options are allowed.  The first value
             shown here is the default one.

             _v_2_2_b_i_s is a 1200 or 2400 bit per second FSK modem.  You can use
             the following options with it :
                   ssiiggnnaall lleevveell    negative value in dB
                   bbiittrraattee         1200 or 2400 bps, fallbacks to 1200
                   ffrreeqquueennccyy       in Hz
                   gguuaarrdd ttoonnee      1800Hz, 550 or none

             _f_s_k___v_2_1 and _f_s_k___v_2_3 modems are respectively 300 and 75 / 1200 bit
             per second FSK modems.  _f_s_k___v_2_3 is asymetric, the caller receives
             at 1200 bps.  You can use the following options with them :
                   ssiiggnnaall lleevveell    negative value in dB
                   ffrraammee mmooddee      sync, async or n

             _v_2_7_t_e_r is a 2400 or 4800 bit per second DPSK modem.  You can use
             the following options with it :
                   ssiiggnnaall lleevveell    negative value in dB
                   bbiittrraattee         2400 or 4800 bps
                   tteepp             0 or 1, use TEP tone
                   oollddttrraaiinn        0 or 1, use trained values on restart

             _v_1_7 is a 7200 to 14400 bit per second QAM modem.  You can use the
             following options with it :
                   ssiiggnnaall lleevveell    negative value in dB
                   bbiittrraattee         7200, 9600, 12000 or 14400 bps
                   tteepp             0 or 1, use TEP tone
                   sshhoorrttttrraaiinn      0 or 1, use short training sequence

             The default is to use a v22bis modem at 1200bps using a 1800Hz
             guard tone

             The modems are restarted when SIGUSR1 is received. The sending
             queue is flushed and the other side's modem is ordered to do the
             same on SIGUSR2.

     For the moment the v17 modem needs to be run with tep set to one, and
     both v17 and v27ter modems needs to be restarted at least once in order
     to work.

     Also, modems might be broken after a restart and decode incoherent bytes,
     particulary if the restart happends on only one side.
