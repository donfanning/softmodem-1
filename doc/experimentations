-- over the phone, from sip phone at home --
fsk_v21 300bps works well, even with bad sound isolation
fsk_v23 75/1200bps doesn't work
v22bis at 1200bps works unreliably, the connection goes up->negociated->...5s...->down
    it works better with guardtone=none
    when i improve the physical sound isolation, the connection goes longer
    the volume (signal level ?) is critical too
v22bis at 2400bps suffers the same problems, and the connection seems even shorter

some phones have echo cancelation that can interfere, particulary if the volume is high

-- directly connect to tty --
when the traffic is so low that it's a nonsense to run ppp over it, for example fsk_v21, try to get a shell directly by using the modem's tty.
openbsd server : run getty(8) by changing the ttyp* line in /etc/ttys
    ttypa   "/usr/libexec/getty std.600"    vt100   on secure
    and kill -HUP 1
linux server : run getty with
    sudo /sbin/getty 300 /dev/pts/40 vt100
openbsd client (ttyp9) : connect to the tty with cu(1)
    cu -l ttyp9
of course it is very dangerous because corrupted commands could be executed, the only checks are the parity/framing, using async parity / start-stop bits.
need to find a way to avoid printing caracters that blocks the receiving terminal
